**How It Works:**
The program uses an ArrayList to store tasks dynamically.
It displays a menu to the user for performing different operations.
The user inputs the corresponding number to perform actions like adding, viewing, updating, deleting, or marking tasks as completed.
The ArrayList methods like add(), get(), set(), and remove() handle the task operations.
